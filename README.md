# Continuity Audio Essays

This repository contains a collection of audio essays by **Shawn K. Ellis**.  
The essays present the foundations of digital migration, computational environments,  
and machine-scale continuity. Each recording reflects the conceptual framework  
used throughout the ContinuityM project.

## Contents

The following essays are included in this audio set:

- **01 – Self-Modeling Systems**  
- **02 – Human Digital Migration**  
- **03 – The Computational Earth**  
- **04 – The Computational Solar System**  
- **05 – Continuity and the Structure of Reality**

All files are provided in MP3 format for general accessibility and distribution.

## Download

Each file may be downloaded individually, and future volumes will appear under  
the same release structure.

## Project Purpose

The Continuity Audio Essays accompany the written ContinuityM materials.  
They present the conceptual progression from early digital migration
